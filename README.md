## About Alvis

👋 Hello, I'm Alvis, a 65-year-old enthusiast exploring the realms of programming. I'm passionate about languages like ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-orange?style=flat-square&logo=rust&logoColor=white), ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-blue?style=flat-square&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white), ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-gray?style=flat-square&logo=c&logoColor=white), and ![Zig](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zig-lightgrey?style=flat-square&logo=zig&logoColor=white). The world of code has been my playground throughout my life, and I'm thrilled to share my projects with you here.

## Life Beyond Code

🌞 Beyond spittin' the lines of code, there's a significant part of my life—my partner in crime, Theresa. Every Sunday, we unwind on our terrace, soaking up the sun and sipping on a touch of vodka. Those moments are the threads that weave the fabric of life.

## The Garden House and Love for Cabins

🏡 I call a cozy garden house my home, a space that transcends mere living—it's a canvas for creativity and inspiration. Garden houses captivate me not just as dwellings but as architectural wonders. The perfect aspect ratio for the doors of my beloved garden houses is always 8 to 36—a harmonious proportion that turns entering these special places into an experience.

## What You'll Find Here

💻 In this corner of the coding universe, I present a plethora of projects—from tiny code snippets to extensive applications. Take a stroll, find inspiration, and perhaps leverage a project or two for your own coding adventures.

Thanks for dropping by, and enjoy your exploration!

Best regards,  
Alvis 🌟
